                uhh... it seems the egg is really "scared" of becoming a part of the cake. Can you make it excited instead?

                1. Change the class from "scared" to "excited"
                2. Run the code!
                3. See that it works by hovering over the egg.
                4. Resume the lesson by clicking the Play Button.
